    <p>The human penis is an external male intromittent organ that additionally<br>
         serves as the urinary duct. The main parts are the root (radix); the body (corpus); and <br>
         the epithelium of the penis including the shaft skin and the foreskin (prepuce) covering the<br>
          glans penis. The body of the penis is made up of three columns of tissue: two corpora cavernosa<br>
           on the dorsal side and corpus spongiosum between them on the ventral side. The human male urethra <br>
           passes through the prostate gland, where it is joined by the ejaculatory duct, and then through the penis. <br>
           The urethra traverses the corpus spongiosum, and its opening, the meatus (/miːˈeɪtəs/), lies on the tip of the <br>
           glans penis. It is a passage both for urination and ejaculation of semen (see male reproductive system.)<br>
        Most of the penis develops from the same embryonic tissue as the <br> clitoris in females. The skin around the penis and the urethra share the same embryonic ori<br>
        gin as the labia minora in females.[1][2] An erection is the stiffening expansion and orthogonal<br>
         reorientation of the penis, which occurs during sexual arousal. Erections can occur in non-sexual <br>
         situations; spontaneous non-sexual erections frequently occur during adolescence and sleep. In its flaccid <br>
         state the penis is smaller, gives to pressure, and the glans is covered by the foreskin. In its fully erect state,<br>
          the corpus becomes rigid and the glans becomes engorged but not rigid. An erect penis may be straight or curved<br>
           and may point at an upward angle, a downward angle, or straight ahead. As of 2015, the average erect human penis <br>
           is 13.12 cm (5.17 in) long and has a circumference of 11.66 cm (4.59 in).[3][4] Neither age nor size of the flaccid<br>
            penis accurately predicts erectile length.</p>
